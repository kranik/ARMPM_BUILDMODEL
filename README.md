# Power Model generation for ARM big.LITTLE on ODROID XU3 platform.
**_Kris Nikov 2016_**

The work presented here is carried out by me, [Dr Kris Nikov](kris.nikov@bris.ac.uk) as part of my PhD project in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Enginnering at the Univeristy of Bristol,UK.

The primary project supervisor was [Dr Jose Nunez-Yanez](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/jose-l-nunez-yanez/overview.html). This work was initially supported by ARM Research funding, through an EPSRC iCASE studentship and the University of Bristol and by the EPSRC ENEAC grant number EP/N002539/1.

**As of March 2018, I have officially graduated so this project is currently independent!**

Full details about the methodology are presented in my dissertation _Power Modelling and Analysis on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems_.

**As of February 2019 the code is no loger actively maintained, though I have some plans for a possuble update on the multi-thread model methodology!**
