# Power Model generation for ARM big.LITTLE aka _ARMPM\_BUILDMODEL_

**As of March 2018, I have officially graduated, so this project is currently closed.**

Full details about the methodology and the produced models are presented in the dissertation [_Power Modelling and Analysis on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems_](https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~eejlny/downloads/kris_thesis.pdf).

**As of February 2019 the code is no loger actively maintained, though I have some plans for a possuble update on the multi-thread model methodology!**

## Getting Started

The scripts contained in this repo represent the second part of the power modelling and analysis methodology, that I have developed as part of my PhD, namely the offline model generation and analysis. They work with the results generated by the [_DATACOLLECT_](https://github.com/kranik/DATACOLLECT) scripts. 

The whole model generation and validation process takes multiple steps:
